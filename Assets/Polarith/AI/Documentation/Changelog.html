<h1>Changelog</h1>
<h2>[v1.5.1] After Patch Fixing</h2>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>When using a prediction method for a steering behaviour, circle gizmos are now displayed at the predicted position</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>AIMWander: Works again now, was broken after the introduction of the better self-recognition</li>
</ul>
<h2>[v1.5] Performance and Usability</h2>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Pro]</strong> With this patch, we laid the foundation for new formation components arriving in the next patches</li>
<li>All Polarith AI inspectors are now Unity-conform, especially all foldouts and tabs</li>
<li>All enhancements and fixes allow for great example and demo creation in future patches</li>
<li>The core steering algorithms are now deterministic when the whole application infrastructure is deterministic as well, have a look at the corresponding manual page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Pro]</strong> Added AIMPerformance, a new component that replaces AIMThreading and provides further performance optimizations</li>
<li><strong>[Pro]</strong> AIMPerformance: Added single-threaded load balancing which equally distributes agent updates over the available frames</li>
<li>Added AIMContextEvaluation: By inheriting from this class, you have full control over the update cycle of all AIMContext instances within the scene</li>
<li>AIMSteeringPerceiver: Implemented spatial hashing using a regular grid to improve the performance of the overall perception pipeline</li>
<li>AIMSteeringPerceiver: Implemented lazy percept receiving such that a percept is processed only if it is really relevant to at least one agent, this improves the overall performance</li>
<li>AIMSteeringFilter: Added a Range parameter that filters percepts before they are processed by a behaviour, this can improve the performance a lot</li>
<li>AIMSteeringTag: Added a Radius parameter to improve the handling of differently sized objects, so the same parameters can now be used for different object sizes</li>
<li>Added LayerBlending and LayerNormalization: All AIMSteeringBehaviour components are now able to store their intermediate results, these can then be normalized or applied to the Context using a different operation, this allows for a much more powerful behaviour combination to easily achieve boids, herds etc.</li>
<li>All AIMSteeringBehaviour and AIMReduction components can now predict their own future position based on fixed parameters or their actual velocity</li>
<li>Implemented a better self-recognition so that a percept representing the agent itself is ignored by behaviours (no need to have an inner radius for this purpose any longer)</li>
<li>Optimized the velocity tracking: When the velocity reaches the zero vector, the last valid non-zero vector is used to provide at least a valid direction</li>
<li>Instead of using a tracked or physics-related velocity, it is now possible to let the behaviour use a direction based on its rotation (most behaviours only need the direction and not the magnitude of the velocity vector)</li>
<li>Added a button to the behaviour inspectors that displays or hides more advanced options to improve the overall user experience</li>
<li>Added the two special predefined sensors LeftRightXY and DiagonalXY which might be useful for certain 2D setups but impossible to create without having AIMPlanarShaper</li>
<li>Improved the documentation content, look and feel</li>
</ul>
